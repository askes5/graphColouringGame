    abstract = {The game domination number of a (simple, undirected) graph is defined by the following game. Two players, A and D, orient the edges of the graph alternately until all edges are oriented. Player D starts the game, and his goal is to decrease the domination number of the resulting digraph, while A is trying to increase it. The game domination number of the graph G, denoted by γg(G), is the domination number of the directed graph resulting from this game. This is well defined if we suppose that both players follow their optimal strategies. We determine the game domination number for several classes of graphs and provide general inequalities relating it to other graph parameters.}

    abstract = "We prove that the game coloring number, and therefore the game chromatic number, of a planar graph is at most 18. This is a slight improvement of the current upper bound of 19. Perhaps more importantly, we bound the game coloring number of a graph G in terms of a new parameter r(G). We use this result to give very easy proofs of the best known upper bounds on game coloring number for forests, interval graphs, chordal graphs, outerplanar graphs, and line graphs and to give a new upper bound on the game coloring number of graphs embeddable on orientable surfaces with bounded genus."
