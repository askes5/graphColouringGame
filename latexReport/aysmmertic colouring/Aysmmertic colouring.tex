    \section{Introduction}
    
    The standard graph colouring game is played between two players, Alice and Bob. They take turns colouring single vertices in a given graph. The natural extension of this game is to allow more players, or equivalently allow Alice and Bob to colour more than one vertex in each turn. This was first formally introduced by Kierstead in \cite{kierstead2005} as the $(a,b)$--colouring game. The $(a,b)$--colouring game is the same as the standard coluring game with the single exception that on each turn Alice colours $a$ vertices and Bob $b$ vertices. 
    
    The $(a,b)$--game chromatic number, $\chi_g(G;a,b)$, is then the smallest $t$ such that Alice has a winning strategy with $t$ colours in the $(a,b)$--colouring game on the graph $G$.
        
    Kierstead also introduces the $(a,b)$--marking game, an extension of the marking game where  on each turn Alice marks $a$ vertices and Bob $b$ vertices. 
    
    The $(a,b)$--colouring number,$\col(G;a,b)$ is then the smallest $s$ such that Alice has a strategy that guarantees a score of less than $s$ in the $(a,b)$--marking game on the graph $G$.
    
%    The first appearance of this colouring game, that I am aware of, is by Faigle, U. and Kern, U. and Kierstead, H. and Trotter, W. T. in \cite{FaKeKiTr1993}.
    
    In \cite{kierstead2005} Kierstead proves a series of upper and lower bounds on $\chi_g(\FF;a,b)$, where $\FF$ is the family of forests. The principle of which is that if $b>a$ then $\chi_g(\FF;a,b)=\infty$. In \cite{kierYang2005} Kierstead and Yang further investigate the $(a,b)$--marking game. They show that if G has an orientation with maximum outdegree $k$ then $\col(G;a,b)$ is at most $(2k +
    2)$. Then in \cite{yangZhu2008} Yang and Zhu extend the popular activation strategy for the $(1,1)$--marking game to the $(a,b)$--marking game.
    
    \section{The class of forests}
    The following theorem is all the bounds for $\chi_g(\FF;a,b)$ shown in \cite{kierstead2005}.    
    \begin{theorem} [Theroem 1 in \cite{kierstead2005}]
        Let $a,b$ be positive integers.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item If $a<b$ then $\chi_g(\FF;a,b)=\col(\FF;a,b)=\infty$
            \item If $b\leq a$ then $b+2\leq \chi_g(\FF;a,b)\leq \col(\FF;a,b)\leq b+2$    
            \item If $b\leq a < \max{2b,3}$ then $b+3 \leq \chi_g(\FF;a,b)$
            \item If $4\leq 2b \leq a \leq 3b$ then $\chi_g(\FF;a,b)\leq b+2<b+3\leq \col(\FF;a,b)$
            \item If $3b\leq a$ then $\col(\FF;a,b)\leq b+2$ 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{theorem}
    
    The proofs of the upper bounds tend to use the fact that     
    $\chi_g(\FF)= \chi_g(\FF;a,b)= \col(\FF;a,b)\col(\FF)=4$. And then provides various unique strategies for Alice to follow.
    
    All the proofs of lower bounds are build on the following graph. Let $T=T_n$ be the forest on the vertex set $V=\bigcup_{i=1}^{20}[n]^i$, where $[n]^i$ is the set of $i$--sequences whose members are chosen from $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. %Recall that sequences are enumerated collection with repetition allowed and order matters.  
    The edges of $T_n$ are pairs of the form $e= (a_1,\dots,a_i) (a_1,\dots,a_{i+1})$. Note that $T_n$ is the graph with $n$ complete rooted $n$--ary trees with depth $20$. They then proceed to show that there is some sufficiently large $n$ such that Bob can win the $(a,b)$--game.
    
%    As an aside the number of vertices in $T_n$ is $n\left(\frac{\left(n^{21}-1\right)}{n-1}\right)$, which rises faster than $n!$.   
    
    \section{The $(a,b)$--marking game}
    
    \begin{theorem}[Theorem 1 in \cite{kierYang2005}]
        Let a be an integer and $G$ be a graph with $\Delta^*(G) = k\leq a$. Then
        $\col(G;a,1) \leq 2k + 2$.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{quotation}
        Before proceeding we illustrate this theorem with the following fanciful Tame
        Woodstock Problem. Suppose that a dinner-rock concert is being organized for
        thousands of people over acres of farmland. The middle-aged audience will
        come, spread out their picnic blankets, listen to the music, and talk with their
        neighbors. The overwhelmed caterers will prepare and deliver meals to unfed
        diners (in no particular order) continuously throughout the night on trays holding
        four meals each. Any diner who receives a tray will keep one meal for himself
        and distribute the rest, not necessarily to neighbors. The mellow rock fans are
        perfectly willing to wait their turn for dinner as long as at any time not too many
        (more than 7) of their neighbors have already been fed. Is it always possible to
        satisfy this condition?
        
        Assuming that the neighbor relation yields a planar graph G, it has an
        orientation $\vec{G}$ with $\Delta^+\vec{G}\leq 3$. Treating the delivery of a tray by the waiter as a
        move by Bob and the distribution of the remaining meals as a move by Alice, we
        have an instance of the $(3, 1)$-marking game on a graph G with $\Delta^*\vec{G}\leq 3$. Thus
        applying the theorem, we see that the Tame Woodstock Problem is indeed
        solvable.
    \end{quotation}
    
    In \cite{kierYang2005} Kierstead and Yang define a new strategy for Alice when playing the  $(a,1)$--marking game.
    
    \begin{quotation}
        To motivate the formal description of Aliceâ€™s Harmonious Strategy given
        below, we first solve the Tame Woodstock Problem. To satisfy all diners the
        organizers establish the following simple protocol. First the planar adjacency
        graph representing adjacent diners is oriented so that the maximum outdegree is
        at most three. Each diner is responsible for the contentment of his outneighbors.
        The diners agree to the following rules. If a waiter brings a tray of meals to a
        diner, he keeps one for himself and passes the other three to his unfed
        outneighbors (if he has less than three unfed outneighbors, the excess is passed to
        any unfed diner). When a diner passes a meal to an outneighbor we say that he is
        contributing the meal. If a diner receives a contribution of a meal from another
        diner and he has an unfed outneighbor to whom he has not yet contributed then
        he must contribute the meal to such an outneighbor. Otherwise he keeps the meal
        and begins his dinner.
    \end{quotation}
    
    A summery of the Harmonious strategy is as follows. Note that this strategy is most useful if $a$ is larger than the maximum out degree in a linear ordering on the vertices.
    
    Suppose there is a linear ordering on the vertices in G and Bob has just marked a vertex x. Alice plays by performing the following steps $a$ times.    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [Step 1] Alice selects, $y$, the with the least unmarked outneighbor of $x$ to whom $x$ has not yet contributed and then contributes to y. If there is no such vertex she selects the least unmarked vertex.
        \item [Step 2] The contribution from $y$
         is passed along until finally it arrives at a vertex $z$ that has already
        contributed to all its outneighbors.
        \item [Step 3] Alice marks $z$
    \end{itemize}
    
    They proceed to use the Harmonious strategy to find upper bounds for for common graphs. They conclude by providing examples showing that many of the upper bounds are optimal.
