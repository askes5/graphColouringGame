\chapter{Graph Domination}\label{chpt:domSet}

\section{Introduction}

In chapter \ref{chpt:into} we introduced the \textit{Dinner Party Problem}. To formalize the \textit{Dinner Party Problem} we introduce dominating sets. A dominating set can be thought of as a set of guests that feeds everyone at a dinner party.

\begin{definition}
    Let $G$ be a graph. A Dominating set, $D$, of $G$ is a subset of $V(G)$ such that every vertex in $V(G)$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $D$.
\end{definition} 
\begin{definition}
    Let $G$ be a graph. The Domination number, $\gamma(G)$, of $G$ is the minimum size of a dominating set in $G$.
\end{definition}

Suppose we wish to build a 5g network in a city. We consider a graph of buildings in a city. Where the vertices are buildings and two vertices $A$ and $B$ are connected if a 5g tower placed on building $A$ one will provide service to building $B$. A minimum number of towers is a dominating set if this graph.

The size of a minimal dominating set is in some sense a measure of how unconnected a graph. A graph with a low domination number has high connectivity, and a graph with a high domination number has low connectivity. For example, a city that is densely packed requires less towers. Every new 5g tower reaches many buildings. Whereas a sparsely populated city will require more towers. Each tower only services a few buildings.   

The dominating game was first introduced in the form we consider in Bo\v{s}tjan Bre\v{s}ar, Sandi Klav\v{z}ar, and Douglas RallF 2010 \cite{BrKlRa2010}. There have been earlier versions of a similar dominating game, though these games considered minimising the dominating number in an induced orientation of a graph. In the game we consider Alice and Bob build a dominating set directly and Alice attempts to minimise the size of the dominating set.

In this chapter we show how the dominating game can be bounded in terms of both the number of vertices and the dominating number.

%\end{definition}

\section{The Dominating game}

We define the dominating game as follows. Let $G$ be a graph, $t$ be a target score and initialise a dominating set $D=\emptyset$. On alternating turns, beginning with Alice, Alice and Bob add a vertex to $D$. The game stops when $D$ forms a dominating set in $G$. The score of the game, $s$, is the size if the dominating set at the end of the game, that is $s=|D|$. Alice wins if $s<t$ and Bob wins otherwise. %todo add the requirement that on each turn the D must grow?

\begin{definition}(game domination number)
    Let $G$ be a graph. The game dominating number, $\gamma_g(G)$ is the minimum target score such that Alice always has a winning strategy.
\end{definition} 

%\begin{lemma}
%    Let $G$ be a graph. 
%        
%    \[\gamma(G) \geq \alpha(G)\]
%\end{lemma}
%
%\begin{proof}
%    Let $X$ be a minimum dominating set in some graph $G=(V,E)$. By definition of dominating set vertex in $V$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in      
%\end{proof}
%    
%Recall that $\chi(G)$ is the chromatic number of the graph $G$.
%
%\begin{theorem} [Willis 3.1 \cite{Willis2011BoundsFT}] \label{willis3.1}
%    For any graph $G = (V,E)$ 
%
%    \[\alpha(G) \leq \frac{ \left | {V} \right |}{\chi(G)}\]
%\end{theorem}
%
%Recall that $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of any vertex in $G$.
%
%\begin{theorem} [Balakrishnan 10.3.2 \cite{balakrishnan2012}] \label{balakrishnan10.3.2}
%    For any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, 
%    
%    \[ \left\lceil {\frac{n}{1+\Delta(G)}} \right\rceil \leq \gamma(G) \leq n - \Delta(G)\]    
%\end{theorem}
    
For some graph, $G$, $\gamma(G)$ is the size of the smallest domination set and hence if the score of the dominating game is less than $\gamma(G)$ then Alice cannot win. Therefore $\gamma(G)$ is a lower bound for the game domination number and $\gamma(G)\leq\gamma_g(G)$. 

Theorem \ref{thm:oreDomUpper}, is a well known result in graph theory. We will show that theorem \ref{thm:oreDomUpper} provides us a lower bound for the game domination number.

\begin{theorem}[Ore 1962 \cite{oysteinore1962}] \label{thm:oreDomUpper} 
    For any connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices,     
    \[\gamma(G) \leq \frac{n}{2}\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:domlow}
    Let $\GG$ be a family of graphs and $\gamma(\GG)$ tight upper bound for the domination number of $\GG$. That is for all $G\in\GG$ $\gamma(G)\leq\gamma(\GG)$ and there exists some $G\in\GG$ such that $\gamma(G)=\gamma(\GG)$. Then,
    \[\gamma(\GG) \leq  \gamma_g(\GG)\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\GG$ be a family of graphs and $G\in\GG$ a graph such that $\gamma(G) = \gamma(\GG)$.
    Therefore for $G$ we are unable to find a dominating set with less than $ \gamma(\GG) $ vertices.
    Therefore there cannot be a winning strategy for Alice with a score less than $\gamma(\GG)$.
    Therefore $\gamma(\GG) \leq \gamma_g(\GG)$
\end{proof}

%add table of classes of graphs

\begin{corollary} \label{thm:gamedomLow}
    Let $G$ be a connected graph with $n$ vertices, such that $n \geq 4$. Then,    
    \[  \frac{n}{2} \leq \gamma_g(G)  \]    
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices.
    
    Consider the complete graph with $2$ vertices $K_2$, a dominating set in $K_2$ is a single vertex, and hence $\gamma(K_2)=n/2=1$. Therefore $n/2$ is a tight upper bound for $\gamma(G)$. 
    
    Therefore by theorems \ref{thm:oreDomUpper} and \ref{thm:domlow} $ n/2 \leq \gamma_g(G)$.
\end{proof}

Corollary \ref{thm:gamedomLow} does not say that for all graphs with domination number less than $n/2$ Alice will always lose. Rather a target score greater than $n/2$ is needed to ensure Alice will always win on a connected graph.

%TODO insert disucssion
%C \ref{thm:gamedomLow} is also proved in Alona, Baloghc, Bollobas, and Szabo 2002 \cite{AlBABoSz2002}. not true, is a diffferent game

An upper bound for the game domination number for a class of graphs is a target score that guarantees Alice has a winning strategy. Consider some graph $G$, the vertex set $V(G)$ is a dominating set and hence we have an upper bound for the game domination number, $\gamma_g(G) \leq |V(G)|$. However, we can do better.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:gamedomup}
    Let $G$ be a graph and $\gamma(G)$ the dominating number of $G$, then 
    \[\gamma_g(G)<2\gamma(G)\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $G$ be a graph and $X\subseteq V(G)$ a dominating set such that $|X| = \gamma(G)$. On Alice's first turn she picks any vertex in $X$. Suppose Bob has just chosen a vertex and $D$ is the current dominating set. Alice's strategy is too pick any unchosen vertex, $v\in X$. After $\gamma(G)$ turns the game must have ended as $X$ is a dominating set and Alice picks a vertex from $X$ in each turn. On each turn Alice and Bob each add one vertex to $D$, hence the size of $D$ is at most $2\gamma$.
\end{proof}
%hence bounds for game relie on bounds for dom num

We can see from theorem \ref{thm:gamedomup} that finding better upper bounds for the game dominating number is a matter of finding better bounds for the dominating number and is out of the scope of this paper. 
%For a class of graphs we can find betters bounds by finding a strategies that end the game in less turns. 

%todo add more bounds based on classes of graphs

Kinnersley, William B. and West, Douglas B. and Zamani, Reza 2013 \cite{KiWeZa2013} conjectured the following. 
\begin{conjecture}[ Kinnersley, William B. and West, Douglas B. and Zamani, Reza 2013 \cite{KiWeZa2013}] \label{thm:treedomup}
    Let $T$ be a tree with $n$ vertices. Then,    
    \[ \gamma_g(T) \leq \left\lceil \frac{3n}{5} \right\rceil\]
\end{conjecture}
 It was shown in Bujt\'{a}s, Csilla 2015 that Conjecture \ref{thm:gamedomup} holds for forests with no isolated vertices and in which no two leaves have distance 4.
%\begin{proof}
%    Let $T$ be a tree with $n$ vertices. On Alice's first move she picks the vertex, $v$, with maximal degree. Initialise $A=N[v]$ to denote the activated vertices. 
%
%    Suppose Bob has just picked a vertex $u$ and let $D$ be the current dominating set in $T$. The winning strategy for Alice is the greedy strategy as follows.    
%    
%    Let $U=V(T)\ba D$ the unchosen vertices in $T$. Alice uses algorithm \ref{alg:greedy} to update $A$ and choose the next vertex.
%        
%    \begin{algorithm}[h]

%        \begin{algorithmic}[1]

%            \State let $x\in U$ be the vertex that maximises $|N(x)\ba A|$
%            \State $A\gets A \cup N(x)$            
%            \State Choose $x$

%   worst case path graph requires twice the minimum of the path graph???
%   
%   with no opponent this will give n/3 thus at worst with the opponent it will take 2n/3 
%       
%    At worst Alice will add two vertices to

\section{The $(a,b)$--dominating game}

The natural extension of the dominating game is to allow Alice and Bob to select more than one vertex on each turn. We define this extension as the $(a,b)$--dominating game when Alice is allowed to select $a$ vertices per turn and Bob $b$ vertices.

\begin{definition}[Game Domination Number]
    Let $G$ be a graph and $a,b\in\mathbb{N}$ integers. The game dominating number $\gamma_g(G;a,b)$ is the smallest target score such that Alice has a winning strategy when playing the $(a,b)$--dominating game.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem} 
    Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices and $a,b>1$ integers. Then,
%    \[\gamma_{g}(G;1,b) \geq (b+1)\gamma(G) \]    
    \[\gamma_{g}(G;a,b) \leq \frac{a+b}{a}\gamma(G)\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    This proof proceeds in much the same way as the proof of theorem \ref{thm:gamedomup}.
    
   Let $G$ be a graph and $X\subseteq V(G)$ a dominating set of $G$ such that $|X| = \gamma(G)$. One Alice's first move she chooses any $a$ vertices in $X$. Suppose Bob has just chosen $b$ vertices and $D$ is the current dominating set. Alice's strategy is to pick any $a$ unchosen vertices, $v_1,\dots,v_a \in X$. After $\frac{\gamma(G)}{a}$ rounds the game must have ended as $X$ is a dominating set and at least $a$ elements of $X$ are chosen each round. In each round Alice adds $a$ vertices to $D$ and Bob adds $b$ vertices to $D$, hence the size of $D$ is at most $(a+b)\frac{\gamma(G)}{a}$.
\end{proof}
